## cs210 project 3 - Grocery Tracker

- I designed a modular and object-oriented solution using a class (GroceryTracker) that cleanly encapsulates file reading, frequency counting using a std::map
- I could improve the code by allowing case-insensitive input (e.g., recognizing “apples” and “Apples” as the same item) and supporting multi-word items using getline() instead of cin.
- The most challenging part was getting the map to correctly track frequencies while maintaining the format of the output and writing the histogram cleanly.


  ### Transferable skills:
  - File I/O operations
  - Working with maps and associative containers
  - Modular class design and encapsulation
  - Input validation and user interaction
